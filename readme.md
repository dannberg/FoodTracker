This app is being built following Apple's [Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html) tutorial.

## App Description

We're building a simple meal-tracking application called FoodTracker. The app shows a list of meals, along with meal name, picture, and star rating. Users can add new meals, delete meals, and edit meals.
